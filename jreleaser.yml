  description: FastTuple is a library for generating heterogeneous tuples of primitive types from a runtime defined schema without boxing.
  longDescription: |
    There are lots of good things about working on the JVM, like a world class JIT, operating system threads, 
    and a world class garbage collector. However, one limiting factor can often be the interaction between 
    primitive types and referenced types in Java. FastTuple generates heterogeneous collections of primitive 
    values and ensures as best it can that they will be laid out adjacently in memory.
